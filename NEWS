   =================

Release 0.103.0
---------------

This release has again focused on stablization and input
validation. UUIDs are now checked for syntactic correctness.
Fixed clashes with disk name & CDROM. Automatically reboot
Windows guest installs with CDROM still attached. The '-'
character is allowed in guest names. OS types /variants are
now specified using their short names. The way Red Hat distros
are detected is changed to be more robust, and cope with CentOS
and RHEL 5 tree layouts.

Release 0.102.0
---------------

This release has focused on stabilization & improved validation
of user inputs. MAC addresses, UUIDs are checked for uniqueness
wrt to other virtual machines. A few minor bug fixes to avoid
deprecated python features, and installation bugs are resolved.

Release 0.101.0
---------------

This release introduces the first support for provisioning
of QEMU / KVM virtual machines. This requires an updated
libvirt of at least 0.2.0 to enable the qemu driver. The
code for fetching bootable kernel/initrd images has been
refactored to facilitate porting to deal with other non
Fedora / RHEL operating systems. Prototype support for dealing
with SuSE paravirtualized installs is provided. The bootable
ISO image for fully virtualized installs can also be fetched
at runtime from an NFS/HTTP/FTP site, or equivalent initrd
and kernels for baremetal. A list of guest operating systems
is now maintained to enable virtual hardware configuration 
to be optimized to suit a particular guest OS.
