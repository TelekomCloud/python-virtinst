xeninst is a module to help in starting installations of Fedora/Red
Hat Enterprise Linux related distributions inside of a Xen guest.  It
supports both paravirt guests (for which only FC and RHEL guests are
currently supported) as well as fully virtualized guests.  It uses
libvirt (http://www.libvirt.org) for starting things.

Also contained is a simple script xenguest-install.py which uses
xeninst in a command line mode.
